### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?
The html component of lab was great, I understood it but I was not prepeared for the javascript, I wish we spent more time on how arrow functions worked and event listeners because I struggled with that on this project

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would have went after the strech features and fixed my styling better especially on the featured page.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?
I like my shuffle, like and delete they all work like how they are supposed to work. Something I do want to try next time if adding filtering and search.


### Shout out
Sammy was super helpuf in helping me debug my modal display of songs and he showed me a better way of using 'console.log'.
